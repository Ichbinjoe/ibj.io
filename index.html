        <p>My name is Joe Hirschfeld. I'm about to get married, so in a few
        weeks my name will be Joseph Hirschfeld-Patrick. This is my website. I
        used to not have anything here, but then I realized that I really
        should have something here as the homepage of who I am. I like fast and
        efficient computer projects that just work, and I decided my website
        should follow the same methodology. Everyone should have somewhere to
        tell the world who they are, so here is mine.</p>

        <p>Here is my <a href="./resume.pdf">resume</a>. I am looking for
        full-time employment after May 2019. I have a wide range of experience,
        from embedded development and circuit design all the way to Kubernetes
        cluster management and high performance computing. When I work I want
        to make something that helps the world function better. I enjoy
        embedded and low-level development, networking, efficient computing,
        and complex data storage.</p>

        <h3>Contacting me</h3>
        <p>If you want to get in touch with me, you can email me through joe @
        this domain. If for some reason you want to encrypt whatever you are
        going to send me, I use <a href="https://keybase.io/ibj">Keybase</a>. I
        am also on <a href="https://t.me/ichbinjoe">Telegram</a>, and will
        respond over Google Hangouts - its just my email.</p>

        <h3>Places I have worked</h3>
        <h4>Xetron Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation in Cincinnati, Ohio</h4>
        {{xetron.svg}}
        <p>I worked at Xetron on co-op primarily as an embedded engineer from
        January to May of 2018. I wrote embedded firmware and drivers which
        efficiently used the ARM Cortex-M4 and the associated peripherals in a
        way which was power efficient yet was able to achieve the goal of the
        system with high performance. I was contributed to embedded designs,
        and was in the design approval group for my project. Before this co-op,
        I had minimal embedded experience and learned all of what I needed on
        the job. During my time, I exceeded the expectations of even a full
        time employee in both my work quantity and quality.</p>
        <h4>Rockwell Automation in Mayfield Heights, Ohio</h4>
        {{rockwell.svg}}
        <p>I worked at Rockwell Automation on co-op as a software engineer from
        May 2016 to December 2016 and from May 2017 to August 2017. I performed
        significant work on multiple features in Studio 5000 during my time at
        Rockwell, and also provided extensive support for the devops team of
        Studio 5000. On devops, I helped manage a Windows VM cluster of 15
        physical computers and 60 virtual machines. I helped with the
        automation of this cluster as well as notification and visualization
        technologies for use by the developers. When on feature teams, I worked
        on a codebase that was millions of lines of C++ on sections of code
        that were older than I was. I added both new features as well as fixed
        anomalies which were deemed non-trivial by other staff.
        <h4>Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, CAGE Department in Cincinnati, Ohio</h4>
        {{cchmc.svg}}
        <p>I worked part time at Cincinnati Children's Hospital from January to
        May of 2017. During my time, I converted a Perl script which calculated
        covariances of a set of DNA sequence into a multi threaded C++ program.
        The C++ effectively used all cores for computation which it was given
        and as a result had four times faster execution and used 1/10th of the
        memory of the previous Perl script. The research publications which
        rely on my work have been submitted for publication by Alexey
        Porollo.</p>

        <h3>Some other stuff I've done</h3>
        <h4>Minecraft stuff</h4>
        <p>I do a lot of stuff for Minecraft servers. When I was 15 I started
        developing software for Minecraft with the goal of modifying the
        behavior of the game. Since that time, I've taken it professionally,
        writing lots of different software for lots of different facets of
        Minecraft. These include some of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I've lead multiple Minecraft development teams for larger
                server networks. Many of these servers have seen success from
                the results of my projects.</li>
            <li>I have lots of high performance optimizations in a lot of
                different servers - where public software fails, I have written
                server specific patches that enable servers to sometimes handle
                significantly more players than previously possible.</li>
            <li>In my limited free time, I maintain <a
                    href="https://github.com/parallelblock/nuvotifier">NuVotifier</a>,
                a Minecraft server plugin which fixes denial of service issues
                present in previous Votifier plugins.</li>
            <li>I have provided various important patches to the <a
                    href="https://github.com/papermc/paper">Paper</a> project
                including plugin self exception monitoring and some performance
                improvements.</li>
            <li>I responsibly disclosed a DoS, possible DDoS UCP reflection,
                and memory leak vulnerability within <a
                    href="https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord/commit/9ecdde2292885b2fbf95c43a386c291f735a1770">Bungeecord</a>,
                a popular Minecraft proxy.</li>
            <li>I wrote the <a
                    href="https://github.com/parallelblock/mcauthenticator">first
                    open source and free totp plugin</a> for Minecraft.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also help manage the only known Minecraft network to run powered
        by Kubernetes (that I know of, at least). I am generally proud of my
        work within Minecraft - I have been able to work on a lot of first-ever
        projects that may not have gotten off the ground had I not been on the
        team working on it.</p>
        <h4>Homelab stuff</h4>
        <p>I have a bunch of servers networked up together on the same network.
        I really like my homelab, and because of it I am able to run a bunch of
        applications locally in my house, including this website. While this is
        generally a bad idea, its a really cool experiment in virutalization,
        software defined networking, and just a mini-testtube of how things
        work out on the Internet. I made a diagram of my home network below:
        <div class="hc">        
        {{homelab.svg}}
        </div>
        As seen in the diagram, I have a pfSense server, a FreeNAS R510 loaded
        with 5x10TB NAS grade hard drives, two T120 "application" tower
        servers, and one Intel NUC which contains my network LDAP. t0, t1, and
        nuc are in a 3-server Proxmox virtualization cluster. This allows me to
        run many different applications in both QEMU and LXC virtualization.
        Each VM or container sits on one of three VLANs, determining which
        virtualized network the network interface sits on. VLAN 1 routes
        normally to the Internet, VLAN 10 routes first through a VPN then to
        the Internet, and VLAN 30 only routes to uctinc.net peers. This homelab
        has helped me learn a ton about cloud hosting, virtualization,
        networking, as well as many other aspects of modern computing.
        <h4>UC Robotics</h4>
        <p>I am the vice president of the UC Robotics Team. Each year, the UC
        Robotics Team competes in the International Ground Vehicle Competition
        (IGVC). In IGVC 2018, UC placed 6th in the auto-navigation portion of
        the competition.  For the 2018-2019 season, I am leading software
        development for the robot. The <a
            href="https://ucrobotics.gitlab.io">UC Robotics Team</a> website is
        a great place to see more about the team during the year.
        <h4>uctinc.net</h4>
        <p>Through my love of computers and networking, I have started a public
        Tinc mesh network. I am looking for peers! If this is something you may
        be interested in, you can check it out at <a
            href="https://uctinc.net">uctinc.net</a>.</p>
